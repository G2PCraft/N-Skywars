## Nekota Skywars
Nekota Skywars is a skywars plugin for minecraft made by me.

`This plugin is suitable for huge servers.`    * 

I only code it in my free time, so the update frequency will be very slow.

running on spigot `1.8.9` in order to support 1.8-1.12

## Features
* Lobby System `support 1k+ games running at the same time`
    * 2 modes to switch: 'Mini Mode' and 'Network Mode'
    * Game Queue (Auto-find recommended games to join)
    * Load Balancing
    * Server cluster technique [For Networks]
        * Auto find recommended games in Network
        * Total player count display like hypixel
* Map System `independent of game system`
    * Border
    * Create game from maps
    * Visual chest property editor

There are many brand new features yet I can't list them at once :L
